# Kitsune Memory Manager

Kitsune Memory Manager is a stand-alone memory manager library built in C for use in my personal projects. The core design of this library focuses on self-managed heap and adaptable facilities that fit most use cases for applications that require long-term memory management. The primary design of this library stems from the [NinetailsX Graphics Engine](https://github.com/0xDATAWOLF/NinetailsX).
